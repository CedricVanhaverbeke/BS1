<p>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (optional).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</pre><p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <b>-w</b>
and <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code class="inline"><span class="i">$SIG</span>{<span class="w">__WARN__</span>}</code>

to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p>
<p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <b>-X</b> switch.</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a href="functions/eval.html">eval</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.
See <a href="warnings.html">warnings</a>.</p>
<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="accept()-on-closed-socket-0x25s"></a><b>accept() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/accept.html">accept</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Allocation-too-large0x3a-0x25lx"></a><b>Allocation too large: %lx</b>
<p>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'0x25c'-allowed-only-after-types-0x25s"></a><b>'%c' allowed only after types %s</b>
<p>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in pack() or unpack() only
after certain types.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ambiguous-call-resolved-as-CORE0x3a0x3a0x25s()0x2c-qualify-as-such-or-use-0x26"></a><b>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</b>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">subs</span></code>
 pragma).</p>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::</span></code>
 prefix
on the operator (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">CORE::log</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="perlsub.html#Subroutine-Attributes">"Subroutine Attributes" in perlsub</a> or
<a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ambiguous-range-in-transliteration-operator"></a><b>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</b>
<p>(F) You wrote something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-z-0//</a></code> which doesn't mean anything at
all.  To include a <code class="inline">-</code>
 character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-z-0//</a></code> was synonymous with
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr/a-y//</a></code>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ambiguous-use-of-0x25s-resolved-as-0x25s"></a><b>Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</b>
<p>(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'0x7c'-and-'0x3c'-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line"></a><b>'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to
redirect STDIN using '&lt;'.  Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'0x7c'-and-'0x3e'-may-not-both-be-specified-on-command-line"></a><b>'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which 'splits' output into two streams, such as</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">OUT</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="q">&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span> or <a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a> <span class="q">&quot;Can&#39;t write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    while <span class="s">(</span><span class="q">&lt;STDIN&gt;</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>
        <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a><span class="sc">;</span>
        <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="i">OUT</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span>
    <a class="l_k" href="functions/close.html">close</a> <span class="w">OUT</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a name="Applying-0x25s-to-0x25s-will-act-on-scalar(0x25s)"></a><b>Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</b>
<p>(W misc) The pattern match (<code class="inline"><span class="q">//</span></code>
), substitution (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/s.html">s///</a></code>), and
transliteration (<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/tr.html">tr///</a></code>) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value -- the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash -- and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See <a href="functions/grep.html">grep</a> and <a href="functions/map.html">map</a> for
alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Args-must-match-0x23!-line"></a><b>Args must match #! line</b>
<p>(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.  Since some systems
impose a one-argument limit on the #! line, try combining switches;
for example, turn <code class="inline">-w -<span class="w">U</span></code>
 into <code class="inline">-<span class="w">wU</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Arg-too-short-for-msgsnd"></a><b>Arg too short for msgsnd</b>
<p>(F) msgsnd() requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-argument-is-not-a-HASH-or-ARRAY-element"></a><b>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element</b>
<p>(F) The argument to exists() must be a hash or array element or a
subroutine with an ampersand, such as:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{"susie"}[12]
    &amp;do_something</pre></li>
<li><a name="0x25s-argument-is-not-a-HASH-or-ARRAY-element-or-slice"></a><b>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</b>
<p>(F) The argument to delete() must be either a hash or array element,
such as:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{"susie"}[12]</pre><p>or a hash or array slice, such as:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{"susie", "queue"}</pre></li>
<li><a name="0x25s-argument-is-not-a-subroutine-name"></a><b>%s argument is not a subroutine name</b>
<p>(F) The argument to exists() for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exists.html">exists</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span></code>
 must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exists.html">exists</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 will generate this
error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Argument-0x220x25s0x22-isn't-numeric0x25s"></a><b>Argument "%s" isn't numeric%s</b>
<p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Argument-list-not-closed-for-PerlIO-layer-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer "%s"</b>
<p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers take care of transforming
data between external and internal representations.)  Perl stopped parsing
the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer.
If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be
the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Array-0x400x25s-missing-the-0x40-in-argument-0x25d-of-0x25s()"></a><b>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</b>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="assertion-botched0x3a-0x25s"></a><b>assertion botched: %s</b>
<p>(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Assertion-failed0x3a-file-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Assertion failed: file "%s"</b>
<p>(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Assignment-to-both-a-list-and-a-scalar"></a><b>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</b>
<p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="A-thread-exited-while-0x25d-threads-were-running"></a><b>A thread exited while %d threads were running</b>
<p>(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily the main
thread) exited while there were still other threads running.
Usually it's a good idea to first collect the return values of the
created threads by joining them, and only then exit from the main
thread.  See <a href="threads.html">threads</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-access-disallowed-key-'0x25s'-in-a-restricted-hash"></a><b>Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash</b>
<p>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in
the current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-bless-into-a-reference"></a><b>Attempt to bless into a reference</b>
<p>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the bless() operator is expected to be
the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You've
supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/bless.html">bless</a> <span class="i">$self</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$proto</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>when you intended</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/bless.html">bless</a> <span class="i">$self</span><span class="cm">,</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/ref.html">ref</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$proto</span><span class="s">)</span> || <span class="i">$proto</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>If you actually want to bless into the stringified version
of the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for
example by:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/bless.html">bless</a> <span class="i">$self</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;$proto&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-delete-disallowed-key-'0x25s'-from-a-restricted-hash"></a><b>Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash</b>
<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
which is not in its key set.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-delete-readonly-key-'0x25s'-from-a-restricted-hash"></a><b>Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash</b>
<p>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
declared readonly from a restricted hash.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-free-non-arena-SV0x3a-0x0x25lx"></a><b>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx</b>
<p>(P internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-free-nonexistent-shared-string"></a><b>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string</b>
<p>(P internal) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-free-temp-prematurely"></a><b>Attempt to free temp prematurely</b>
<p>(W debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
free_tmps() routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
SV before the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the
free_tmps() routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-glob-pointers"></a><b>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</b>
<p>(P internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-scalar"></a><b>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</b>
<p>(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or
that SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-join-self"></a><b>Attempt to join self</b>
<p>(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an
impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need
to move the join() to some other thread.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-pack-pointer-to-temporary-value"></a><b>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</b>
<p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the "p" pack() template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the "p" pack() template to
avoid this warning.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-reload-0x25s-aborted."></a><b>Attempt to reload %s aborted.</b>
<p>(F) You tried to load a file with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code> that failed to
compile once already.  Perl will not try to compile this file again
unless you delete its entry from %INC.  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a> and
<a href="perlvar.html#0x25INC">"%INC" in perlvar</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-set-length-of-freed-array"></a><b>Attempt to set length of freed array</b>
<p>(W) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed.  You
can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last index
of an array and later assigning through that reference. For example</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">$r</span> = <a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a> <span class="s">{</span><a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">@a</span><span class="sc">;</span> \<span class="i">$#a</span><span class="s">}</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$$r</span> = <span class="n">503</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a name="Attempt-to-use-reference-as-lvalue-in-substr"></a><b>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</b>
<p>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to substr()
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See <a href="functions/substr.html">substr</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bad-arg-length-for-0x25s0x2c-is-0x25d0x2c-should-be-0x25s"></a><b>Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %s</b>
<p>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), semctl()
or shmctl().  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct&nbsp;msqid_ds&nbsp;*), sizeof(struct&nbsp;semid_ds&nbsp;*), and
sizeof(struct&nbsp;shmid_ds&nbsp;*).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bad-evalled-substitution-pattern"></a><b>Bad evalled substitution pattern</b>
<p>(F) You've used the <code class="inline">/e</code> switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate,
most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bad-filehandle0x3a-0x25s"></a><b>Bad filehandle: %s</b>
<p>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the
symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an
open(), or did it in another package.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bad-free()-ignored"></a><b>Bad free() ignored</b>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had never
been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <code class="inline"><span class="w">PERL_BADFREE</span></code>
 to 0.</p>
<p>This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with "hard"
dynamic linking, like <code class="inline"><span class="w">AIX</span></code>
 and <code class="inline"><span class="w">OS</span>/<span class="n">2</span></code>
. It is a bug of <code class="inline"><span class="w">Berkeley</span> <span class="w">DB</span></code>

which is left unnoticed if <code class="inline"><span class="w">DB</span></code>
 uses <i>forgiving</i> system malloc().</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bad-hash"></a><b>Bad hash</b>
<p>(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Badly-placed-()'s"></a><b>Badly placed ()'s</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bad-name-after-0x25s0x3a0x3a"></a><b>Bad name after %s::</b>
<p>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
didn't finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside
of quotes, so</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">$var</span> = <span class="q">&#39;myvar&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$sym</span> = <span class="w">mypack::</span><span class="i">$var</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>is not the same as</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">$var</span> = <span class="q">&#39;myvar&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="i">$sym</span> = <span class="q">&quot;mypack::$var&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a name="Bad-realloc()-ignored"></a><b>Bad realloc() ignored</b>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called realloc() on something that had
never been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled
by setting environment variable <code class="inline"><span class="w">PERL_BADFREE</span></code>
 to 1.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bad-symbol-for-array"></a><b>Bad symbol for array</b>

</li>
<li><a name="Bareword-found-in-conditional"></a><b>Bareword found in conditional</b>
<p>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FOO</span> || <a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">constant</span> <span class="i">TYPO</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="w">TYOP</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;foo&quot;</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>The <code class="inline"><span class="w">strict</span></code>
 pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bareword-0x220x25s0x22-not-allowed-while-0x22strict-subs0x22-in-use"></a><b>Bareword "%s" not allowed while "strict subs" in use</b>
<p>(F) With "strict subs" in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the "=&gt;"
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Bareword-0x220x25s0x22-refers-to-nonexistent-package"></a><b>Bareword "%s" refers to nonexistent package</b>
<p>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo::</span></code>
, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="BEGIN-failed--compilation-aborted"></a><b>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</b>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="BEGIN-not-safe-after-errors--compilation-aborted"></a><b>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</b>
<p>(F) Perl found a <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 subroutine (or a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> directive, which
implies a <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x5c1-better-written-as-0x241"></a><b>\1 better written as $1</b>
<p>(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Binary-number-0x3e-0b11111111111111111111111111111111-non-portable"></a><b>Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="bind()-on-closed-socket-0x25s"></a><b>bind() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to

</li>
<li><a name="binmode()-on-closed-filehandle-0x25s"></a><b>binmode() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried binmode() on a filehandle that was never opened.

<li><a name="Buffer-overflow-in-prime_env_iter0x3a-0x25s"></a><b>Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</b>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to
iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition
which was too long, so it was truncated to the string shown.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Callback-called-exit"></a><b>Callback called exit</b>
<p>(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via call_sv()
exited by calling exit.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s()-called-too-early-to-check-prototype"></a><b>%s() called too early to check prototype</b>
<p>(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-compress-integer-in-pack"></a><b>Cannot compress integer in pack</b>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was too large to compress.  The BER
compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you
attempted to compress Infinity or a very large number (&gt; 1e308).
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-compress-negative-numbers-in-pack"></a><b>Cannot compress negative numbers in pack</b>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was negative.  The BER compressed integer

</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-convert-a-reference-to-0x25s-to-typeglob"></a><b>Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob</b>
<p>(F) You manipulated Perl's symbol table directly, stored a reference in it,
then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax. The access
triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is no legal conversion
from that type of reference to a typeglob.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Cannot-copy-to-0x25s-in-0x25s"></a><b>Cannot copy to %s in %s</b>
<p>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy a value to an internal type that cannot
be directly assigned not.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can-only-compress-unsigned-integers-in-pack"></a><b>Can only compress unsigned integers in pack</b>
<p>(F) An argument to pack("w",...) was not an integer.  The BER compressed

to compress something else.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-bless-non-reference-value"></a><b>Can't bless non-reference value</b>
<p>(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl "enforces"
encapsulation of objects.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-0x22break0x22-in-a-loop-topicalizer"></a><b>Can't "break" in a loop topicalizer</b>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><span class="w">break</span></code>
, but you're in a <code class="inline">foreach</code>
 block rather than
a <code class="inline">given</code>
 block. You probably meant to use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/last.html">last</a></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-0x22break0x22-outside-a-given-block"></a><b>Can't "break" outside a given block</b>

<p>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't have ANYTHING defined
in it, let alone methods.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-call-method-0x220x25s0x22-on-an-undefined-value"></a><b>Can't call method "%s" on an undefined value</b>
<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the

<li><a name="Can't-call-method-0x220x25s0x22-on-unblessed-reference"></a><b>Can't call method "%s" on unblessed reference</b>
<p>(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you
didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't an
object reference until it has been blessed.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-chdir-to-0x25s"></a><b>Can't chdir to %s</b>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline">perl -x/foo/bar</code>, but <code class="inline">/foo/bar</code> is not a directory
that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-check-filesystem-of-script-0x220x25s0x22-for-nosuid"></a><b>Can't check filesystem of script "%s" for nosuid</b>

only with arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-coerce-0x25s-to-integer-in-0x25s"></a><b>Can't coerce %s to integer in %s</b>
<p>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't

<p>(F) Currently, only scalar variables can be declared with a specific
class qualifier in a "my", "our" or "state" declaration.  The semantics may be
extended for other types of variables in future.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-declare-0x25s-in-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Can't declare %s in "%s"</b>
<p>(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as "my", "our" or

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-inplace-edit-without-backup"></a><b>Can't do inplace edit without backup</b>
<p>(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try
reading from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say
<code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span>.<span class="w">bak</span></code>
, or some such.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-inplace-edit0x3a-0x25s-would-not-be-unique"></a><b>Can't do inplace edit: %s would not be unique</b>
<p>(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14
characters and Perl was unable to create a unique filename during

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-0x7bn0x2cm0x7d-with-n-0x3e-m-in-regex0x3b-marked-by-0x3c---HERE-in-m0x2f0x25s0x2f"></a><b>Can't do {n,m} with n &gt; m in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) Minima must be less than or equal to maxima. If you really want your
regexp to match something 0 times, just put {0}. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered. See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-setegid!"></a><b>Can't do setegid!</b>
<p>(P) The setegid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator of
suidperl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-seteuid!"></a><b>Can't do seteuid!</b>
<p>(P) The setuid emulator of suidperl failed for some reason.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-setuid"></a><b>Can't do setuid</b>
<p>(F) This typically means that ordinary perl tried to exec suidperl to do
setuid emulation, but couldn't exec it.  It looks for a name of the form
sperl5.000 in the same directory that the perl executable resides under
the name perl5.000, typically /usr/local/bin on Unix machines.  If the
file is there, check the execute permissions.  If it isn't, ask your
sysadmin why he and/or she removed it.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-do-waitpid-with-flags"></a><b>Can't do waitpid with flags</b>
<p>(F) This machine doesn't have either waitpid() or wait4(), so only
waitpid() without flags is emulated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-emulate--0x25s-on-0x23!-line"></a><b>Can't emulate -%s on #! line</b>
<p>(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this
point.  For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a <b>-x</b> on the #!
line.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-0x25s-0x25s-endian-0x25ss-on-this-platform"></a><b>Can't %s %s-endian %ss on this platform</b>
<p>(F) Your platform's byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian,
or it has a very strange pointer size.  Packing and unpacking big- or
little-endian floating point values and pointers may not be possible.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-exec-0x220x25s0x220x3a-0x25s"></a><b>Can't exec "%s": %s</b>
<p>(W exec) A system(), exec(), or piped open call could not execute the
named program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the
permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in
<code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
, the executable in question was compiled for another
architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an interpreter that
can't be run for similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support
#! at all.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-exec-0x25s"></a><b>Can't exec %s</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because
that's what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may
need to mention "perl" on the #! line somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-execute-0x25s"></a><b>Can't execute %s</b>
<p>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the copies of the script to execute
found in the PATH did not have correct permissions.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-an-opnumber-for-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Can't find an opnumber for "%s"</b>
<p>(F) A string of a form <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::word</span></code>
 was given to prototype(), but there
is no builtin with the name <code class="inline"><span class="w">word</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-0x25s-character-property-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Can't find %s character property "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You used <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 but the character property by that name
could not be found. Maybe you misspelled the name of the property
(remember that the names of character properties consist only of
alphanumeric characters), or maybe you forgot the <code class="inline"><span class="w">Is</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="w">In</span></code>
 prefix?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-label-0x25s"></a><b>Can't find label %s</b>
<p>(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's
possible for us to go to.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-0x25s-on-PATH"></a><b>Can't find %s on PATH</b>
<p>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-0x25s-on-PATH0x2c-'.'-not-in-PATH"></a><b>Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH</b>
<p>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.  The
script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running it.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-string-terminator-0x25s-anywhere-before-EOF"></a><b>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</b>
<p>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means
that the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);</pre><p>If you're getting this error from a here-document, you may have included
unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag. A good programmer's

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-find-Unicode-property-definition-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Can't find Unicode property definition "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You may have tried to use <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 which means a Unicode property (for
example <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">Lu</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 is all uppercase letters).  If you did mean to use a
Unicode property, see <a href="perlunicode.html">perlunicode</a> for the list of known properties.
If you didn't mean to use a Unicode property, escape the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
, either
by <code class="inline">\\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 (just the <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
) or by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">Q</span>\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 (the rest of the string, until
possible <code class="inline">\<span class="w">E</span></code>
).</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Can't-get-filespec---stale-stat-buffer0x3f"></a><b>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat() routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking
routine knows about the Perl <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/stat.html">stat</a></code> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name"></a><b>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a

<li><a name="Can't-get-SYSGEN-parameter-value-for-MAXBUF"></a><b>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an answer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-0x22goto0x22-into-the-middle-of-a-foreach-loop"></a><b>Can't "goto" into the middle of a foreach loop</b>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop.  You can't get there from here.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-0x22goto0x22-out-of-a-pseudo-block"></a><b>Can't "goto" out of a pseudo block</b>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump out of what might look like
a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually occurs if
you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which is a no-no.
See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-a-sort-sub-(or-similar-callback)"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)</b>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of the
comparison sub for a sort(), or from a similar callback (such
as the reduce() function in List::Util).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-an-eval-0x25s"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine from an eval-%s</b>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of an eval
"string" or block.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-goto-subroutine-outside-a-subroutine"></a><b>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</b>
<p>(F) The deeply magical "goto subroutine" call can only replace one
subroutine call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole
cloth.  In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD
routine anyway.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-ignore-signal-CHLD0x2c-forcing-to-default"></a><b>Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</b>
<p>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-0x22last0x22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "last" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "last" statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current
block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't count as a "loopish"
block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or grep().  You can
usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.  See
<a href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-linearize-anonymous-symbol-table"></a><b>Can't linearize anonymous symbol table</b>
<p>(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a
package, but failed because the package stash has no name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-load-'0x25s'-for-module-0x25s"></a><b>Can't load '%s' for module %s</b>
<p>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension. This
may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is
incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known to happen
between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your dynamic
extension was built against an older version of the library that is
installed on your system. You may need to rebuild your old dynamic
extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-localize-lexical-variable-0x25s"></a><b>Can't localize lexical variable %s</b>
<p>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
lexical variable using "my" or "state".  This is not allowed.  If you want to
localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with the
package name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-localize-through-a-reference"></a><b>Can't localize through a reference</b>
<p>(F) You said something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a> <span class="i">$$ref</span></code>
, which Perl can't currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref
pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can't be sure
that $ref will still be a reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-0x25s"></a><b>Can't locate %s</b>
<p>(F) You said to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a></code> (or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code>) a file that couldn't be
found. Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC,
unless the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you
need to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where
the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name
to @INC.  Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See
<a href="functions/require.html">require</a> and <a href="lib.html">lib</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-auto0x2f0x25s.al-in-0x40INC"></a><b>Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</b>
<p>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows
autoload, but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes
are a misprint in a function/method name or a failure to <code class="inline"><span class="w">AutoSplit</span></code>

the file, say, by doing <code class="inline"><span class="w">make</span> <span class="w">install</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-loadable-object-for-module-0x25s-in-0x40INC"></a><b>Can't locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</b>
<p>(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like
for example, <code class="inline"><span class="w">foo</span>.<span class="w">so</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="w">bar</span>.<span class="w">dll</span></code>
, but the <a href="DynaLoader.html">DynaLoader</a> module was
unable to locate this library.  See <a href="DynaLoader.html">DynaLoader</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-object-method-0x220x25s0x22-via-package-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
method, nor does any of its base classes.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-package-0x25s-for-0x400x25s0x3a0x3aISA"></a><b>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</b>
<p>(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that
doesn't seem to exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-package-0x25s-for-the-parents-of-0x25s"></a><b>Can't locate package %s for the parents of %s</b>
<p>(W syntax) You did not define (or require/use) the first package,
which is named as a (possibly indirect) parent of the second by
<code class="inline"><span class="i">@ISA</span></code>
 inheritance.  Perl will treat this as if the undefined
package had an empty <code class="inline"><span class="i">@ISA</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-locate-PerlIO0x25s"></a><b>Can't locate PerlIO%s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use in open() a PerlIO layer that does not exist,
e.g. open(FH, "&gt;:nosuchlayer", "somefile").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-make-list-assignment-to-0x5c0x25ENV-on-this-system"></a><b>Can't make list assignment to \%ENV on this system</b>
<p>(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
VMS.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-0x25s-in-0x25s"></a><b>Can't modify %s in %s</b>
<p>(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
to change it, such as with an auto-increment.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-nonexistent-substring"></a><b>Can't modify nonexistent substring</b>
<p>(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed
a NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-modify-non-lvalue-subroutine-call"></a><b>Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</b>
<p>(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such, see <a href="perlsub.html#Lvalue-subroutines">"Lvalue subroutines" in perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-msgrcv-to-read-only-var"></a><b>Can't msgrcv to read-only var</b>
<p>(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
buffer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-0x22next0x22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "next" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "next" statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or
grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops
once.  See <a href="functions/next.html">next</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-0x25s0x3a-0x25s"></a><b>Can't open %s: %s</b>
<p>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code>

filehandle, either implicitly under the <code class="inline">-<span class="w">n</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">-p</code>
 command-line
switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually this
is because you don't have read permission for a file which you named on
the command line.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-a-reference"></a><b>Can't open a reference</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing,
using the 3-arg open() syntax :</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FH</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;&gt;&#39;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$ref</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of
open is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-bidirectional-pipe"></a><b>Can't open bidirectional pipe</b>
<p>(W pipe) You tried to say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">CMD</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;|cmd|&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, which is not supported.
You can try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such
as IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using
"&gt;", and then read it in under a different file handle.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-error-file-0x25s-as-stderr"></a><b>Can't open error file %s as stderr</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-input-file-0x25s-as-stdin"></a><b>Can't open input file %s as stdin</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the
command line for reading.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-output-file-0x25s-as-stdout"></a><b>Can't open output file %s as stdout</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the file specified after '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' on
the command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-output-pipe-(name0x3a-0x25s)"></a><b>Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined
for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-open-perl-script0x25s"></a><b>Can't open perl script%s</b>
<p>(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.</p>
<p>If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell's $PATH search, the -S option causes perl to do that search, so
you don't have to type the path or <code class="inline"><span class="q">`which $scriptname`</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-read-CRTL-environ"></a><b>Can't read CRTL environ</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that environ is not
searched.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-0x22redo0x22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><b>Can't "redo" outside a loop block</b>
<p>(F) A "redo" statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map()
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See <a href="functions/redo.html">redo</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-remove-0x25s0x3a-0x25s0x2c-skipping-file"></a><b>Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</b>
<p>(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup
file.  Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with
the modified file.  The file was left unmodified.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-rename-0x25s-to-0x25s0x3a-0x25s0x2c-skipping-file"></a><b>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</b>
<p>(S inplace) The rename done by the <b>-i</b> switch failed for some reason,
probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-reopen-input-pipe-(name0x3a-0x25s)-in-binary-mode"></a><b>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried
to reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-resolve-method-0x600x25s'-overloading-0x600x25s'-in-package-0x600x25s'"></a><b>Can't resolve method `%s' overloading `%s' in package `%s'</b>
<p>(F|P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as opposed
to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the package. If
method name is <code class="inline">???</code>, this is an internal error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-reswap-uid-and-euid"></a><b>Can't reswap uid and euid</b>
<p>(P) The setreuid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator of
suidperl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-0x25s-from-lvalue-subroutine"></a><b>Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</b>
<p>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as
temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.  This
is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-outside-a-subroutine"></a><b>Can't return outside a subroutine</b>
<p>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-return-0x25s-to-lvalue-scalar-context"></a><b>Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context</b>
<p>(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine,
but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think you meant
to return only one value. You probably meant to write parentheses around
the call to the subroutine, which tell Perl that the call should be in
list context.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-stat-script-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Can't stat script "%s"</b>
<p>(P) For some reason you can't fstat() the script even though you have it
open already.  Bizarre.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-swap-uid-and-euid"></a><b>Can't swap uid and euid</b>
<p>(P) The setreuid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator of
suidperl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-take-log-of-0x25g"></a><b>Can't take log of %g</b>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a
negative number or zero. There's a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the
negative numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-take-sqrt-of-0x25g"></a><b>Can't take sqrt of %g</b>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
negative number.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-undef-active-subroutine"></a><b>Can't undef active subroutine</b>
<p>(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-unshift"></a><b>Can't unshift</b>
<p>(F) You tried to unshift an "unreal" array that can't be unshifted, such
as the main Perl stack.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-upgrade-0x25s-(0x25d)-to-0x25d"></a><b>Can't upgrade %s (%d) to %d</b>
<p>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds "members" to an SV, making it
into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-anonymous-symbol-table-for-method-lookup"></a><b>Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</b>
<p>(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol
table that doesn't have a name.  Symbol tables can become anonymous
for example by undefining stashes: <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a> <span class="i">%Some::Package::</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-an-undefined-value-as-0x25s-reference"></a><b>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</b>
<p>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-bareword-(0x220x25s0x22)-as-0x25s-ref-while-0x22strict-refs0x22-in-use"></a><b>Can't use bareword ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</b>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-0x25!-because-Errno.pm-is-not-available"></a><b>Can't use %! because Errno.pm is not available</b>
<p>(F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for <code class="inline"><span class="i">$!</span></code>
 errno values.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-both-'0x3c'-and-'0x3e'-after-type-'0x25c'-in-0x25s"></a><b>Can't use both '&lt;' and '&gt;' after type '%c' in %s</b>
<p>(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian
byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not
allowed.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-0x25s-for-loop-variable"></a><b>Can't use %s for loop variable</b>
<p>(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a
foreach.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-global-0x25s-in-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Can't use global %s in "%s"</b>
<p>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-'0x25c'-in-a-group-with-different-byte-order-in-0x25s"></a><b>Can't use '%c' in a group with different byte-order in %s</b>
<p>(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type
that is already inside a group with a byte-order modifier.
For example you cannot force little-endianness on a type that
is inside a big-endian group.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-0x22my-0x25s0x22-in-sort-comparison"></a><b>Can't use "my %s" in sort comparison</b>
<p>(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-0x25s-ref-as-0x25s-ref"></a><b>Can't use %s ref as %s ref</b>
<p>(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-string-(0x220x25s0x22)-as-0x25s-ref-while-0x22strict-refs0x22-in-use"></a><b>Can't use string ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</b>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic
references are disallowed.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-subscript-on-0x25s"></a><b>Can't use subscript on %s</b>
<p>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a
subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that
didn't look like a hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-0x5c0x25c-to-mean-0x240x25c-in-expression"></a><b>Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</b>
<p>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form
instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-use-0x22when0x22-outside-a-topicalizer"></a><b>Can't use "when" outside a topicalizer</b>
<p>(F) You have used a when() block that is neither inside a <code class="inline">foreach</code>

loop nor a <code class="inline">given</code>
 block. (Note that this error is issued on exit
from the <code class="inline">when</code>
 block, so you won't get the error if the match fails,
or if you use an explicit <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/continue.html">continue</a></code>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-weaken-a-nonreference"></a><b>Can't weaken a nonreference</b>
<p>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Can't-x0x3d-to-read-only-value"></a><b>Can't x= to read-only value</b>
<p>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value)
with an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Character-in-'C'-format-wrapped-in-pack"></a><b>Character in 'C' format wrapped in pack</b>
<p>(W pack) You said</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/pack.html">pack</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">&quot;C&quot;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$x</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>
<p>where $x is either less than 0 or more than 255; the <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;C&quot;</span></code>
 format is

</li>
<li><a name="Compilation-failed-in-require"></a><b>Compilation failed in require</b>
<p>(F) Perl could not compile a file specified in a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code> statement.
Perl uses this generic message when none of the errors that it
encountered were severe enough to halt compilation immediately.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Complex-regular-subexpression-recursion-limit-(0x25d)-exceeded"></a><b>Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d) exceeded</b>
<p>(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex
situations where back-tracking is required.  Recursion depth is limited
to 32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack cannot grow
arbitrarily.  ("Simple" and "medium" situations are handled without
recursion and are not subject to a limit.)  Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with <code class="inline">while</code>
) rather than
in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so
that it is simpler or backtracks less.  (See <a href="perlfaq2.html">perlfaq2</a> for information
on <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="cond_broadcast()-called-on-unlocked-variable"></a><b>cond_broadcast() called on unlocked variable</b>
<p>(W threads) Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to call
cond_broadcast() on a variable which wasn't locked. The cond_broadcast()
function  is used to wake up another thread that is waiting in a
cond_wait(). To ensure that the signal isn't sent before the other thread
has a chance to enter the wait, it is usual for the signaling thread to
first wait for a lock on variable. This lock attempt will only succeed
after the other thread has entered cond_wait() and thus relinquished the
lock.</p>

<li><a name="cond_signal()-called-on-unlocked-variable"></a><b>cond_signal() called on unlocked variable</b>
<p>(W threads) Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to call

</li>
<li><a name="Deep-recursion-on-subroutine-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Deep recursion on subroutine "%s"</b>
<p>(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly)
100 times more than it has returned.  This probably indicates an
infinite recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in
which case it indicates something else.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="defined(0x40array)-is-deprecated"></a><b>defined(@array) is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on arrays because it
checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use <code class="inline">if (@array) { # not empty }</code> for example.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="defined(0x25hash)-is-deprecated"></a><b>defined(%hash) is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on hashes because it
checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the hash
is empty, just use <code class="inline">if (%hash) { # not empty }</code> for example.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-defines-neither-package-nor-VERSION--version-check-failed"></a><b>%s defines neither package nor VERSION--version check failed</b>
<p>(F) You said something like "use Module 42" but in the Module file
there are neither package declarations nor a <code class="inline"><span class="i">$VERSION</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Delimiter-for-here-document-is-too-long"></a><b>Delimiter for here document is too long</b>
<p>(F) In a here document construct like <code class="inline">&lt;&lt;FOO</code>, the label <code class="inline"><span class="w">FOO</span></code>
 is too
long for Perl to handle.  You have to be seriously twisted to write code
that triggers this error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Deprecated-use-of-my()-in-false-conditional"></a><b>Deprecated use of my() in false conditional</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span> if <span class="n">0</span></code>
.
There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable
not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false
conditional. Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of
static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug, we don't want people
relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar static effect by
declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, eg</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span> if <span class="n">0</span><span class="sc">;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/return.html">return</a> <span class="i">$x</span>++ <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><a name="f"></a>    <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$x</span><span class="sc">;</span> sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/return.html">return</a> <span class="i">$x</span>++ <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>Beginning with perl 5.9.4, you can also use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/state.html">state</a></code> variables to
have lexicals that are initialized only once (see <a href="feature.html">feature</a>):</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="w">state</span> <span class="i">$x</span><span class="sc">;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/return.html">return</a> <span class="i">$x</span>++ <span class="s">}</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a name="DESTROY-created-new-reference-to-dead-object-'0x25s'"></a><b>DESTROY created new reference to dead object '%s'</b>
<p>(F) A DESTROY() method created a new reference to the object which is
just being DESTROYed. Perl is confused, and prefers to abort rather than
to create a dangling reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Did-not-produce-a-valid-header"></a><b>Did not produce a valid header</b>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-did-not-return-a-true-value"></a><b>%s did not return a true value</b>
<p>(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a "1;", though any true value would
do.  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-0x260x25s-instead0x3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)</b>
<p>(W) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as $FOO or some
such.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-0x22local0x22-instead-of-0x22our0x220x3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean "local" instead of "our"?)</b>
<p>(W misc) Remember that "our" does not localize the declared global
variable.  You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which
seems superfluous.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Did-you-mean-0x24-or-0x40-instead-of-0x250x3f)"></a><b>(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</b>
<p>(W) You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key} or
@hash{@keys}.  On the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got
carried away.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Died"></a><b>Died</b>
<p>(F) You passed die() an empty string (the equivalent of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a> <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></code>
) or
you called it with no args and both <code class="inline"><span class="i">$@</span></code>
 and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code>
 were empty.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Document-contains-no-data"></a><b>Document contains no data</b>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-does-not-define-0x25s0x3a0x3aVERSION--version-check-failed"></a><b>%s does not define %s::VERSION--version check failed</b>
<p>(F) You said something like "use Module 42" but the Module did not
define a <code class="inline"><span class="i">$VERSION</span>.</code>
</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'0x2f'-does-not-take-a-repeat-count"></a><b>'/' does not take a repeat count</b>
<p>(F) You cannot put a repeat count of any kind right after the '/' code.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Don't-know-how-to-handle-magic-of-type-'0x25s'"></a><b>Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'</b>
<p>(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="do_study0x3a-out-of-memory"></a><b>do_study: out of memory</b>
<p>(P) This should have been caught by safemalloc() instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Do-you-need-to-predeclare-0x25s0x3f)"></a><b>(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</b>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
"sub", "package", "require", or "use" statement.  If you're referencing
something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have to define the
subroutine or package before the current location.  You can use an empty
"sub foo;" or "package FOO;" to enter a "forward" declaration.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="dump()-better-written-as-CORE0x3a0x3adump()"></a><b>dump() better written as CORE::dump()</b>
<p>(W misc) You used the obsolescent <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/dump.html">dump()</a></code> built-in function, without fully
qualifying it as <code class="inline"><span class="i">CORE::dump</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.  Maybe it's a typo.  See <a href="functions/dump.html">dump</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="dump-is-not-supported"></a><b>dump is not supported</b>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support dump/undump.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Duplicate-free()-ignored"></a><b>Duplicate free() ignored</b>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had
already been freed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Duplicate-modifier-'0x25c'-after-'0x25c'-in-0x25s"></a><b>Duplicate modifier '%c' after '%c' in %s</b>
<p>(W) You have applied the same modifier more than once after a type
in a pack template.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="elseif-should-be-elsif"></a><b>elseif should be elsif</b>
<p>(S syntax) There is no keyword "elseif" in Perl because Larry thinks it's
ugly. Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method named
"elseif" for the class returned by the following block.  This is
unlikely to be what you want.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Empty-0x25s"></a><b>Empty %s</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span></code>
 are used to introduce a named Unicode property, as
described in <a href="perlunicode.html">perlunicode</a> and <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>. You used <code class="inline">\<span class="w">p</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="w">P</span></code>
 in
a regular expression without specifying the property name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="entering-effective-0x25s-failed"></a><b>entering effective %s failed</b>
<p>(F) While under the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">filetest</span></code>
 pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25ENV-is-aliased-to-0x25s"></a><b>%ENV is aliased to %s</b>
<p>(F) You're running under taint mode, and the <code class="inline"><span class="i">%ENV</span></code>
 variable has been
aliased to another hash, so it doesn't reflect anymore the state of the
program's environment. This is potentially insecure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Error-converting-file-specification-0x25s"></a><b>Error converting file specification %s</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've passed
an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the
conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s0x3a-Eval-group-in-insecure-regular-expression"></a><b>%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression</b>
<p>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular
expression that contains the <code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion, which
is unsafe.  See <a href="perlre.html#(0x3f0x7b-code-0x7d)">"(?{ code })" in perlre</a>, and <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s0x3a-Eval-group-not-allowed-at-run-time"></a><b>%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time</b>
<p>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
<code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk, it
is not allowed.  If you insist, you may still do this by explicitly
building the pattern from an interpolated string at run time and using
that in an eval().  See <a href="perlre.html#(0x3f0x7b-code-0x7d)">"(?{ code })" in perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s0x3a-Eval-group-not-allowed0x2c-use-re-'eval'"></a><b>%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'</b>
<p>(F) A regular expression contained the <code class="inline">(?{ ... })</code> zero-width

<p>(F) You used a pattern that nested too many EVAL calls without consuming
any text. Restructure the pattern so that text is consumed.</p>
<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Excessively-long-0x3c0x3e-operator"></a><b>Excessively long &lt;&gt; operator</b>
<p>(F) The contents of a &lt;&gt; operator may not exceed the maximum size of a
Perl identifier.  If you're just trying to glob a long list of
filenames, try using the glob() operator, or put the filenames into a
variable and glob that.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="exec0x3f-I'm-not-*that*-kind-of-operating-system"></a><b>exec? I'm not *that* kind of operating system</b>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> function is not implemented in MacPerl. See <a href="perlport.html">perlport</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Execution-of-0x25s-aborted-due-to-compilation-errors"></a><b>Execution of %s aborted due to compilation errors</b>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a Perl compilation fails.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-eval-via-0x25s"></a><b>Exiting eval via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting an eval by unconventional means, such as a
goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-format-via-0x25s"></a><b>Exiting format via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a format by unconventional means, such as a
goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-pseudo-block-via-0x25s"></a><b>Exiting pseudo-block via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a rather special block construct (like a
sort block or subroutine) by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a
loop control statement.  See <a href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-subroutine-via-0x25s"></a><b>Exiting subroutine via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a subroutine by unconventional means, such
as a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Exiting-substitution-via-0x25s"></a><b>Exiting substitution via %s</b>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a substitution by unconventional means, such
as a return, a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Explicit-blessing-to-''-(assuming-package-main)"></a><b>Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</b>
<p>(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has
the effect of blessing the reference into the package main.  This is
usually not what you want.  Consider providing a default target package,
e.g. bless($ref, $p || 'MyPackage');</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s0x3a-Expression-syntax"></a><b>%s: Expression syntax</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-failed--call-queue-aborted"></a><b>%s failed--call queue aborted</b>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a UNITCHECK,
CHECK, INIT, or END subroutine.  Processing of the remainder of the
queue of such routines has been prematurely ended.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="False-0x5b0x5d-range-0x220x25s0x22-in-regex0x3b-marked-by-0x3c---HERE-in-m0x2f0x25s0x2f"></a><b>False [] range "%s" in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal
character, not another character class like <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">[:alpha:]</code>.  The "-"
in your false range is interpreted as a literal "-".  Consider quoting the
"-", "\-".  The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the
problem was discovered.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Fatal-VMS-error-at-0x25s0x2c-line-0x25d"></a><b>Fatal VMS error at %s, line %d</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS
system service or RTL routine; Perl's exit status should provide more
details.  The filename in "at %s" and the line number in "line %d" tell
you which section of the Perl source code is distressed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="fcntl-is-not-implemented"></a><b>fcntl is not implemented</b>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement fcntl().  What is this, a
PDP-11 or something?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="FETCHSIZE-returned-a-negative-value"></a><b>FETCHSIZE returned a negative value</b>
<p>(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of elements, which
is not possible.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Field-too-wide-in-'u'-format-in-pack"></a><b>Field too wide in 'u' format in pack</b>
<p>(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string start with a length indicator
which can't encode values above 63. So there is no point in asking for
a line length bigger than that. Perl will behave as if you specified
<code class="inline"><span class="w">u63</span></code>
 as format.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-0x25s-opened-only-for-input"></a><b>Filehandle %s opened only for input</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you intended
it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with "+&lt;" or
"+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If you intended only to
write the file, use "&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;".  See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-0x25s-opened-only-for-output"></a><b>Filehandle %s opened only for output</b>
<p>(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If
you intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it
with "+&lt;" or "+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If you
intended only to read from the file, use "&lt;".  See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a>.
Another possibility is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0
(also known as STDIN) for output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-0x25s-reopened-as-0x25s-only-for-input"></a><b>Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input</b>
<p>(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDOUT or STDERR. This occurred because you closed STDOUT or STDERR
previously.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Filehandle-STDIN-reopened-as-0x25s-only-for-output"></a><b>Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output</b>
<p>(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
as STDIN. This occurred because you closed STDIN previously.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Final-0x24-should-be-0x5c0x24-or-0x24name"></a><b>Final $ should be \$ or $name</b>
<p>(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or the
name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="flock()-on-closed-filehandle-0x25s"></a><b>flock() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to flock() got itself closed
some time before now.  Check your control flow.  flock() operates on
filehandles.  Are you attempting to call flock() on a dirhandle by the
same name?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Format-not-terminated"></a><b>Format not terminated</b>
<p>(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Format-0x25s-redefined"></a><b>Format %s redefined</b>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="s">{</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;redefine&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&quot;format NAME =...&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span>
    <span class="s">}</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a name="Found-0x3d-in-conditional0x2c-should-be-0x3d0x3d"></a><b>Found = in conditional, should be ==</b>
<p>(W syntax) You said</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$foo</span> = <span class="n">123</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>
<p>when you meant</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$foo</span> == <span class="n">123</span><span class="s">)</span></pre>
<p>(or something like that).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-found-where-operator-expected"></a><b>%s found where operator expected</b>
<p>(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
operator, it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gdbm-store-returned-0x25d0x2c-errno-0x25d0x2c-key-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key "%s"</b>
<p>(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="gethostent-not-implemented"></a><b>gethostent not implemented</b>
<p>(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement gethostent(), probably
because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every hostname
on the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="get0x25sname()-on-closed-socket-0x25s"></a><b>get%sname() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed
socket.  Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="getpwnam-returned-invalid-UIC-0x250x23o-for-user-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user "%s"</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  The call to <code class="inline"><span class="w">sys</span><span class="i">$getuai</span></code>
 underlying the
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/getpwnam.html">getpwnam</a></code> operator returned an invalid UIC.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="getsockopt()-on-closed-socket-0x25s"></a><b>getsockopt() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed socket.  Did you
forget to check the return value of your socket() call?  See
<a href="functions/getsockopt.html">getsockopt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Global-symbol-0x220x25s0x22-requires-explicit-package-name"></a><b>Global symbol "%s" requires explicit package name</b>
<p>(F) You've said "use strict" or "use strict vars", which indicates 
that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using "my" or "state"), 
declared beforehand using "our", or explicitly qualified to say 
which package the global variable is in (using "::").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="glob-failed-(0x25s)"></a><b>glob failed (%s)</b>
<p>(W glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used for
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code> and <code class="inline"><span class="q">&lt;*.c&gt;</span></code>
.  Usually, this means that you supplied a
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code> pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a
nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in
config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it
were csh (e.g.  <code class="inline"><span class="w">full_csh</span>=<span class="q">&#39;/usr/bin/tcsh&#39;</span></code>
); otherwise, make them all
empty (except that <code class="inline"><span class="w">d_csh</span></code>
 should be <code class="inline"><span class="q">&#39;undef&#39;</span></code>
) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<code class="inline">./Configure -S</code> and rebuild Perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Glob-not-terminated"></a><b>Glob not terminated</b>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Got-an-error-from-DosAllocMem"></a><b>Got an error from DosAllocMem</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to OS/2.  Most probably you're using an obsolete
version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="goto-must-have-label"></a><b>goto must have label</b>
<p>(F) Unlike with "next" or "last", you're not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See <a href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="()-group-starts-with-a-count"></a><b>()-group starts with a count</b>
<p>(F) A ()-group started with a count.  A count is
supposed to follow something: a template character or a ()-group.
 See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-had-compilation-errors"></a><b>%s had compilation errors</b>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 fails.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Had-to-create-0x25s-unexpectedly"></a><b>Had to create %s unexpectedly</b>
<p>(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought
to have existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hash-0x250x25s-missing-the-0x25-in-argument-0x25d-of-0x25s()"></a><b>Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</b>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-has-too-many-errors"></a><b>%s has too many errors</b>
<p>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Hexadecimal-number-0x3e-0xffffffff-non-portable"></a><b>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Identifier-too-long"></a><b>Identifier too long</b>
<p>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$A::B</span></code>
).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions
of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ignoring-0x25s-in-character-class-in-regex0x3b-marked-by-0x3c---HERE-in-m0x2f0x25s0x2f"></a><b>Ignoring %s in character class in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(W) Named Unicode character escapes (\N{...}) may return multi-char
or zero length sequences. When such an escape is used in a character class
its behaviour is not well defined. Check that the correct escape has
been used, and the correct charname handler is in scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-binary-digit-0x25s"></a><b>Illegal binary digit %s</b>
<p>(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-binary-digit-0x25s-ignored"></a><b>Illegal binary digit %s ignored</b>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a
binary number.  Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-character-0x25s-(carriage-return)"></a><b>Illegal character %s (carriage return)</b>
<p>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error
when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk
to your Perl administrator.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-character-in-prototype-for-0x25s-0x3a-0x25s"></a><b>Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</b>
<p>(W syntax) An illegal character was found in a prototype declaration.  Legal
characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, and \.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-declaration-of-anonymous-subroutine"></a><b>Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine</b>
<p>(F) When using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a></code> keyword to construct an anonymous subroutine,
you must always specify a block of code. See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-declaration-of-subroutine-0x25s"></a><b>Illegal declaration of subroutine %s</b>
<p>(F) A subroutine was not declared correctly. See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-division-by-zero"></a><b>Illegal division by zero</b>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in
your logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-hexadecimal-digit-0x25s-ignored"></a><b>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</b>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or
A - F, a - f in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal
number stopped before the illegal character.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-modulus-zero"></a><b>Illegal modulus zero</b>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most
numbers don't take to this kindly.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-number-of-bits-in-vec"></a><b>Illegal number of bits in vec</b>
<p>(F) The number of bits in vec() (the third argument) must be a power of
two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-octal-digit-0x25s"></a><b>Illegal octal digit %s</b>
<p>(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-octal-digit-0x25s-ignored"></a><b>Illegal octal digit %s ignored</b>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal number.
Interpretation of the octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Illegal-switch-in-PERL5OPT0x3a-0x25s"></a><b>Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: %s</b>
<p>(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to set the
following switches: <b>-[CDIMUdmtw]</b>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ill-formed-CRTL-environ-value-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>Ill-formed CRTL environ value "%s"</b>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL's
internal environ array, and encountered an element without the <code class="inline">=</code>

delimiter used to separate keys from values.  The element is ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Ill-formed-message-in-prime_env_iter0x3a-0x7c0x25s0x7c"></a><b>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</b>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical
name or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and
didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(in-cleanup)-0x25s"></a><b>(in cleanup) %s</b>
<p>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>
<p>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">G_KEEPERR</span></code>
 flag could
also result in this warning.  See <a href="perlcall.html#G_KEEPERR">"G_KEEPERR" in perlcall</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Inconsistent-hierarchy-during-C3-merge-of-class-'0x25s'0x3a-merging-failed-on-parent-'0x25s'"></a><b>Inconsistent hierarchy during C3 merge of class '%s': merging failed on parent '%s'</b>
<p>(F) The method resolution order (MRO) of the given class is not
C3-consistent, and you have enabled the C3 MRO for this class.  See the C3
documentation in <a href="mro.html">mro</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="In-EBCDIC-the-v-string-components-cannot-exceed-2147483647"></a><b>In EBCDIC the v-string components cannot exceed 2147483647</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to EBCDIC.  Internally, v-strings are stored as
Unicode code points, and encoded in EBCDIC as UTF-EBCDIC.  The UTF-EBCDIC
encoding is limited to code points no larger than 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Infinite-recursion-in-regex0x3b-marked-by-0x3c---HERE-in-m0x2f0x25s0x2f"></a><b>Infinite recursion in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) You used a pattern that references itself without consuming any input
text. You should check the pattern to ensure that recursive patterns
either consume text or fail.</p>
<p>The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Initialization-of-state-variables-in-list-context-currently-forbidden"></a><b>Initialization of state variables in list context currently forbidden</b>
<p>(F) Currently the implementation of "state" only permits the initialization
of scalar variables in scalar context. Re-write <code class="inline"><span class="w">state</span> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$a</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="n">42</span></code>
 as
<code class="inline"><span class="w">state</span> <span class="i">$a</span> = <span class="n">42</span></code>
 to change from list to scalar context. Constructions such
as <code class="inline"><span class="w">state</span> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">@a</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="i">foo</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 will be supported in a future perl release.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Insecure-dependency-in-0x25s"></a><b>Insecure dependency in %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or
setgid, or when you specify <b>-T</b> to turn it on explicitly.  The
tainting mechanism labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly
from the user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any
such data is used in a "dangerous" operation, you get this error.  See
<a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Insecure-directory-in-0x25s"></a><b>Insecure directory in %s</b>
<p>(F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or
setgid script if <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
 contains a directory that is writable by
the world.  Also, the PATH must not contain any relative directory.
See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Insecure-0x24ENV0x7b0x25s0x7d-while-running-0x25s"></a><b>Insecure $ENV{%s} while running %s</b>

the path to a known value, using trustworthy data.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-0x25s-number"></a><b>Integer overflow in %s number</b>
<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
either as a literal or as an argument to hex() or oct() is too big for
your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.
On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
operations.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-format-string-for-0x25s"></a><b>Integer overflow in format string for %s</b>
<p>(F) The indexes and widths specified in the format string of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/printf.html">printf()</a></code>
or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sprintf.html">sprintf()</a></code> are too large.  The numbers must not overflow the size of
integers for your architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Integer-overflow-in-version"></a><b>Integer overflow in version</b>
<p>(F) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for the
size of integers for your architecture.  This is not a warning
because there is no rational reason for a version to try and use a
element larger than typically 2**32.  This is usually caused by
trying to use some odd mathematical operation as a version, like
100/9.</p>

discovered.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Internal-inconsistency-in-tracking-vforks"></a><b>Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number of times
you've called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fork.html">fork</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code>, to determine whether the current call
to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> should affect the current script or a subprocess (see
<a href="perlvms.html#exec-LIST">"exec LIST" in perlvms</a>).  Somehow, this count has become scrambled, so
Perl is making a guess and treating this <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> as a request to
terminate the Perl script and execute the specified command.</p>

<p>(F) While unpacking, the string buffer was already used up when an unpack
length/code combination tried to obtain more data. This results in
an undefined value for the length. See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>

<p>(W io) You tried to do an lstat on a filehandle.  What did you mean
by that?  lstat() makes sense only on filenames.  (Perl did a fstat()
instead on the filehandle.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Lvalue-subs-returning-0x25s-not-implemented-yet"></a><b>Lvalue subs returning %s not implemented yet</b>
<p>(F) Due to limitations in the current implementation, array and hash

</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-PERLLIB_PREFIX"></a><b>Malformed PERLLIB_PREFIX</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to OS/2.  PERLLIB_PREFIX should be of the form</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="w">prefix1</span><span class="sc">;</span><span class="w">prefix2</span></pre>
<p>or
    prefix1 prefix2</p>
<p>with nonempty prefix1 and prefix2.  If <code class="inline"><span class="w">prefix1</span></code>
 is indeed a prefix of
a builtin library search path, prefix2 is substituted.  The error may
appear if components are not found, or are too long.  See
"PERLLIB_PREFIX" in <a href="perlos2.html">perlos2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-prototype-for-0x25s0x3a-0x25s"></a><b>Malformed prototype for %s: %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use a function with a malformed prototype.  The
syntax of function prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for
obvious errors like invalid characters.  A more rigorous check is run
when the function is called.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-UTF-8-character-(0x25s)"></a><b>Malformed UTF-8 character (%s)</b>
<p>(S utf8) (F) Perl detected a string that didn't comply with UTF-8
encoding rules, even though it had the UTF8 flag on.</p>
<p>One possible cause is that you set the UTF8 flag yourself for data that
you thought to be in UTF-8 but it wasn't (it was for example legacy
8-bit data). To guard against this, you can use Encode::decode_utf8.</p>
<p>If you use the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="i">encoding</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">UTF</span>-<span class="n">8</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 PerlIO layer for input, invalid byte
sequences are handled gracefully, but if you use <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code>
, the flag is
set without validating the data, possibly resulting in this error
message.</p>
<p>See also <a href="Encode.html#Handling-Malformed-Data">"Handling Malformed Data" in Encode</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-UTF-16-surrogate"></a><b>Malformed UTF-16 surrogate</b>
<p>Perl thought it was reading UTF-16 encoded character data but while
doing it Perl met a malformed Unicode surrogate.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-UTF-8-string-in-pack"></a><b>Malformed UTF-8 string in pack</b>
<p>(F) You tried to pack something that didn't comply with UTF-8 encoding
rules and perl was unable to guess how to make more progress.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-UTF-8-string-in-unpack"></a><b>Malformed UTF-8 string in unpack</b>
<p>(F) You tried to unpack something that didn't comply with UTF-8 encoding
rules and perl was unable to guess how to make more progress.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Malformed-UTF-8-string-in-'0x25c'-format-in-unpack"></a><b>Malformed UTF-8 string in '%c' format in unpack</b>
<p>(F) You tried to unpack something that didn't comply with UTF-8 encoding
rules and perl was unable to guess how to make more progress.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Maximal-count-of-pending-signals-(0x25s)-exceeded"></a><b>Maximal count of pending signals (%s) exceeded</b>
<p>(F) Perl aborted due to a too important number of signals pending. This
usually indicates that your operating system tried to deliver signals
too fast (with a very high priority), starving the perl process from
resources it would need to reach a point where it can process signals
safely. (See <a href="perlipc.html#Deferred-Signals-(Safe-Signals)">"Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)" in perlipc</a>.)</p>
</li>

<p>(W regexp) The pattern you've specified would be an infinite loop if the
regular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.  The &lt;-- HERE
shows in the regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x220x25s0x22-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word"></a><b>"%s" may clash with future reserved word</b>
<p>(W) This warning may be due to running a perl5 script through a perl4
interpreter, especially if the word that is being warned about is
"use" or "my".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25-may-not-be-used-in-pack"></a><b>% may not be used in pack</b>
<p>(F) You can't pack a string by supplying a checksum, because the
checksumming process loses information, and you can't go the other way.
See <a href="functions/unpack.html">unpack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Method-for-operation-0x25s-not-found-in-package-0x25s-during-blessing"></a><b>Method for operation %s not found in package %s during blessing</b>

<p>(S) An advisory indicating that the previous error may have been caused
by a missing delimiter on a string or pattern, because it eventually
ended earlier on the current line.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Misplaced-_-in-number"></a><b>Misplaced _ in number</b>
<p>(W syntax) An underscore (underbar) in a numeric constant did not
separate two digits.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-argument-to--0x25c"></a><b>Missing argument to -%c</b>
<p>(F) The argument to the indicated command line switch must follow

 within
double-quotish context.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-comma-after-first-argument-to-0x25s-function"></a><b>Missing comma after first argument to %s function</b>
<p>(F) While certain functions allow you to specify a filehandle or an
"indirect object" before the argument list, this ain't one of them.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-command-in-piped-open"></a><b>Missing command in piped open</b>
<p>(W pipe) You used the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">FH</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;| command&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Missing-control-char-name-in-0x5cc"></a><b>Missing control char name in \c</b>
<p>(F) A double-quoted string ended with "\c", without the required control
character name.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-name-in-0x22my-sub0x22"></a><b>Missing name in "my sub"</b>
<p>(F) The reserved syntax for lexically scoped subroutines requires that
they have a name with which they can be found.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-0x24-on-loop-variable"></a><b>Missing $ on loop variable</b>
<p>(F) Apparently you've been programming in <b>csh</b> too much.  Variables
are always mentioned with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells, where it
can vary from one line to the next.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Missing-operator-before-0x25s0x3f)"></a><b>(Missing operator before %s?)</b>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  Often the missing operator is a comma.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-right-brace-on-0x25s"></a><b>Missing right brace on %s</b>
<p>(F) Missing right brace in <code class="inline">\<span class="i">p</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">\<span class="i">P</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Missing-right-curly-or-square-bracket"></a><b>Missing right curly or square bracket</b>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets than closing
ones.  As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place you
were last editing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="(Missing-semicolon-on-previous-line0x3f)"></a><b>(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</b>
<p>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
"%s found where operator expected".  Don't automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just because you saw this message.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Modification-of-a-read-only-value-attempted"></a><b>Modification of a read-only value attempted</b>
<p>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant.  You didn't, of course, try "2 = 1", because the compiler
catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><a name="mod"></a>    sub <span class="m">mod</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$_</span>[<span class="n">0</span>] = <span class="n">1</span> <span class="s">}</span>
    <span class="i">mod</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Another way is to assign to a substr() that's off the end of the string.</p>
<p>Yet another way is to assign to a <code class="inline">foreach</code>
 loop <i>VAR</i> when <i>VAR</i>
is aliased to a constant in the look <i>LIST</i>:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">        <span class="i">$x</span> = <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span>
        foreach <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$n</span> <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span>
            <span class="i">$n</span> *= <span class="n">2</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="c"># modifies the $x, but fails on attempt to modify the 2</span>
        <span class="s">}</span></pre>
</li>
<li><a name="Modification-of-non-creatable-array-value-attempted0x2c-0x25s"></a><b>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
backwards.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Modification-of-non-creatable-hash-value-attempted0x2c-0x25s"></a><b>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, %s</b>
<p>(P) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence, and it
couldn't be created for some peculiar reason.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Module-name-must-be-constant"></a><b>Module name must be constant</b>
<p>(F) Only a bare module name is allowed as the first argument to a "use".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Module-name-required-with--0x25c-option"></a><b>Module name required with -%c option</b>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline">-M</code>
 or <code class="inline">-m</code> options say that Perl should load some module, but
you omitted the name of the module.  Consult <a href="perlrun.html">perlrun</a> for full details
about <code class="inline">-M</code>
 and <code class="inline">-m</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="More-than-one-argument-to-open"></a><b>More than one argument to open</b>
<p>(F) The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a></code> function has been asked to open multiple files. This
can happen if you are trying to open a pipe to a command that takes a
list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify a piped open mode.
See <a href="functions/open.html">open</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="msg0x25s-not-implemented"></a><b>msg%s not implemented</b>
<p>(F) You don't have System V message IPC on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Multidimensional-syntax-0x25s-not-supported"></a><b>Multidimensional syntax %s not supported</b>
<p>(W syntax) Multidimensional arrays aren't written like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">3</span>]</code>
.
They're written like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">1</span>][<span class="n">2</span>][<span class="n">3</span>]</code>
, as in C.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'0x2f'-must-follow-a-numeric-type-in-unpack"></a><b>'/' must follow a numeric type in unpack</b>
<p>(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '/', but this did not
follow some unpack specification producing a numeric value.
See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x22my-sub0x22-not-yet-implemented"></a><b>"my sub" not yet implemented</b>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented.  Don't try
that yet.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x220x25s0x22-variable-0x25s-can't-be-in-a-package"></a><b>"%s" variable %s can't be in a package</b>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use
local() if you want to localize a package variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Name-0x220x25s0x3a0x3a0x25s0x22-used-only-once0x3a-possible-typo"></a><b>Name "%s::%s" used only once: possible typo</b>
<p>(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.
If you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it
again somehow to suppress the message.  The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our.html">our</a></code> declaration is
provided for this purpose.</p>
<p>NOTE: This warning detects symbols that have been used only once so $c, @c,
%c, *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are considered
the same; if a program uses $c only once but also uses any of the others it
will not trigger this warning.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Negative-'0x2f'-count-in-unpack"></a><b>Negative '/' count in unpack</b>
<p>(F) The length count obtained from a length/code unpack operation was
negative.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Negative-length"></a><b>Negative length</b>
<p>(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer
length that is less than 0.  This is difficult to imagine.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Negative-offset-to-vec-in-lvalue-context"></a><b>Negative offset to vec in lvalue context</b>
<p>(F) When <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/vec.html">vec</a></code> is called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Nested-quantifiers-in-regex0x3b-marked-by-0x3c---HERE-in-m0x2f0x25s0x2f"></a><b>Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses. So
things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal. The &lt;-- HERE shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered.</p>
<p>Note that the minimal matching quantifiers, <code class="inline"><span class="i">*?</span></code>
, <code class="inline">+?</code>, and
<code class="inline"><span class="q">??</span></code>
 appear to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-never-introduced"></a><b>%s never introduced</b>
<p>(S internal) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of
scope before it could possibly have been used.</p>

<li><a name="next0x3a0x3amethod0x2fnext0x3a0x3acan0x2fmaybe0x3a0x3anext0x3a0x3amethod-cannot-find-enclosing-method"></a><b>next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method cannot find enclosing method</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::method</a></code> needs to be called within the context of a
real method in a real package, and it could not find such a context.
See <a href="mro.html">mro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-0x25s-allowed-while-running-setuid"></a><b>No %s allowed while running setuid</b>
<p>(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
setgid script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there
will be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
securable.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-comma-allowed-after-0x25s"></a><b>No comma allowed after %s</b>
<p>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or "indirect object" is not
allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.</p>
<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported a
constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating system
does not support that particular constant. Hopefully you did use an
explicit import list for the constants you expect to see, please see
<a href="functions/use.html">use</a> and <a href="functions/import.html">import</a>. While an explicit import list
would probably have caught this error earlier it naturally does not
remedy the fact that your operating system still does not support that
constant. Maybe you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import
list of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> or in the constant name at the line where
this error was triggered?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-command-into-which-to-pipe-on-command-line"></a><b>No command into which to pipe on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you want to pipe the output from this command.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-DB0x3a0x3aDB-routine-defined"></a><b>No DB::DB routine defined</b>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch, but
for some reason the  current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a <code class="inline"><span class="w">Devel::</span></code>

module) didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each
statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-dbm-on-this-machine"></a><b>No dbm on this machine</b>
<p>(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM.  See <a href="SDBM_File.html">SDBM_File</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-DB0x3a0x3asub-routine-defined"></a><b>No DB::sub routine defined</b>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch, but
for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a <code class="inline"><span class="w">Devel::</span></code>

module) didn't define a <code class="inline"><span class="w">DB::sub</span></code>
 routine to be called at the beginning
of each ordinary subroutine call.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-*-e*-allowed-in-setuid-scripts"></a><b>No <b>-e</b> allowed in setuid scripts</b>
<p>(F) A setuid script can't be specified by the user.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-error-file-after-20x3e-or-20x3e0x3e-on-command-line"></a><b>No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '2&gt;' or a '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't
find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stderr.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-group-ending-character-'0x25c'-found-in-template"></a><b>No group ending character '%c' found in template</b>
<p>(F) A pack or unpack template has an opening '(' or '[' without its
matching counterpart. See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-input-file-after-0x3c-on-command-line"></a><b>No input file after &lt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line

name of the file from which to read data for stdin.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-0x23!-line"></a><b>No #! line</b>
<p>(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-next0x3a0x3amethod-'0x25s'-found-for-0x25s"></a><b>No next::method '%s' found for %s</b>
<p>(F) <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::method</a></code> found no further instances of this method name
in the remaining packages of the MRO of this class.  If you don't want
it throwing an exception, use <code class="inline"><span class="w">maybe::next::method</span></code>

or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/next.html">next::can</a></code>. See <a href="mro.html">mro</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x22no0x22-not-allowed-in-expression"></a><b>"no" not allowed in expression</b>
<p>(F) The "no" keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and
returns no useful value.  See <a href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-output-file-after-0x3e-on-command-line"></a><b>No output file after &gt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a lone '&gt;' at the end of the command line, so it
doesn't know where you wanted to redirect stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-output-file-after-0x3e-or0x3e0x3e-on-command-line"></a><b>No output file after &gt; or&gt;&gt; on command line</b>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a '&gt;' or a '&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't
find the name of the file to which to write data destined for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-package-name-allowed-for-variable-0x25s-in-0x22our0x22"></a><b>No package name allowed for variable %s in "our"</b>
<p>(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in "our"
declarations, because that doesn't make much sense under existing
semantics.  Such syntax is reserved for future extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-Perl-script-found-in-input"></a><b>No Perl script found in input</b>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -x</code>
, but no line was found in the file beginning
with #! and containing the word "perl".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-setregid-available"></a><b>No setregid available</b>
<p>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setregid() call for
your system.</p>
</li>

your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-0x25s-specified-for--0x25c"></a><b>No %s specified for -%c</b>
<p>(F) The indicated command line switch needs a mandatory argument, but
you haven't specified one.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-class-field-0x220x25s0x22-in-variable-0x25s-of-type-0x25s"></a><b>No such class field "%s" in variable %s of type %s</b>
<p>(F) You tried to access a key from a hash through the indicated typed variable
but that key is not allowed by the package of the same type.  The indicated
package has restricted the set of allowed keys using the <a href="fields.html">fields</a> pragma.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-class-0x25s"></a><b>No such class %s</b>
<p>(F) You provided a class qualifier in a "my", "our" or "state" declaration, but
this class doesn't exist at this point in your program.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-pipe-open"></a><b>No such pipe open</b>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The internal routine my_pclose() tried to
close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught
earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="No-such-signal0x3a-SIG0x25s"></a><b>No such signal: SIG%s</b>
<p>(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to %SIG that was
not recognized.  Say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/kill.html">kill</a> -l</code>
 in your shell to see the valid signal
names on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-CODE-reference"></a><b>Not a CODE reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See
also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-format-reference"></a><b>Not a format reference</b>
<p>(F) I'm not sure how you managed to generate a reference to an anonymous
format, but this indicates you did, and that it didn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-GLOB-reference"></a><b>Not a GLOB reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a "typeglob" (that is, a
symbol table entry that looks like <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span></code>
), but found a reference to
something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to find out what
kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-HASH-reference"></a><b>Not a HASH reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but found a
reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to
find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-an-ARRAY-reference"></a><b>Not an ARRAY reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-perl-script"></a><b>Not a perl script</b>
<p>(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.  The line must
mention perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-SCALAR-reference"></a><b>Not a SCALAR reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but found
a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref() function
to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-subroutine-reference"></a><b>Not a subroutine reference</b>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See
also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-a-subroutine-reference-in-overload-table"></a><b>Not a subroutine reference in overload table</b>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
doesn't somehow point to a valid subroutine.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-enough-arguments-for-0x25s"></a><b>Not enough arguments for %s</b>
<p>(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Not-enough-format-arguments"></a><b>Not enough format arguments</b>
<p>(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the next line
supplied.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s0x3a-not-found"></a><b>%s: not found</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="no-UTC-offset-information0x3b-assuming-local-time-is-UTC"></a><b>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</b>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent
to UTC.  If it's not, define the logical name
<i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i> to translate to the number of seconds which
need to be added to UTC to get local time.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Non-string-passed-as-bitmask"></a><b>Non-string passed as bitmask</b>
<p>(W misc) A number has been passed as a bitmask argument to select().
Use the vec() function to construct the file descriptor bitmasks for
select. See <a href="functions/select.html">select</a></p>
</li>
<li><a name="Null-filename-used"></a><b>Null filename used</b>
<p>(F) You can't require the null filename, especially because on many
machines that means the current directory!  See <a href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NULL-OP-IN-RUN"></a><b>NULL OP IN RUN</b>
<p>(P debugging) Some internal routine called run() with a null opcode
pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Null-picture-in-formline"></a><b>Null picture in formline</b>
<p>(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
specification.  It was found to be empty, which probably means you
supplied it an uninitialized value.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Null-realloc"></a><b>Null realloc</b>
<p>(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NULL-regexp-argument"></a><b>NULL regexp argument</b>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big time.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="NULL-regexp-parameter"></a><b>NULL regexp parameter</b>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Number-too-long"></a><b>Number too long</b>
<p>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to
about 250 characters.  You've exceeded that length.  Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation.  In
the meantime, try using scientific notation (e.g. "1e6" instead of
"1_000_000").</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Octal-number-in-vector-unsupported"></a><b>Octal number in vector unsupported</b>
<p>(F) Numbers with a leading <code class="inline"><span class="n">0</span></code>
 are not currently allowed in vectors.
The octal number interpretation of such numbers may be supported in a
future version.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Octal-number-0x3e-037777777777-non-portable"></a><b>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
<p>See also <a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for writing portable code.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-arguments-for-overload0x3a0x3aconstant"></a><b>Odd number of arguments for overload::constant</b>
<p>(W overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of
arguments. The arguments should come in pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-elements-in-anonymous-hash"></a><b>Odd number of elements in anonymous hash</b>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Odd-number-of-elements-in-hash-assignment"></a><b>Odd number of elements in hash assignment</b>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Offset-outside-string"></a><b>Offset outside string</b>
<p>(F, W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation
with an offset pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to
imagine.  The sole exceptions to this are that zero padding will
take place when going past the end of the string when either
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sysread.html">sysread()</a></code>ing a file, or when seeking past the end of a scalar opened
for I/O (in anticipation of future reads and to imitate the behaviour
with real files).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s()-on-unopened-0x25s"></a><b>%s() on unopened %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was
never initialized.  You need to do an open(), a sysopen(), or a socket()
call, or call a constructor from the FileHandle package.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="-0x25s-on-unopened-filehandle-0x25s"></a><b>-%s on unopened filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to invoke a file test operator on a filehandle
that isn't open.  Check your control flow.  See also <a href="functions/-X.html">-X</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="oops0x3a-oopsAV"></a><b>oops: oopsAV</b>
<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="oops0x3a-oopsHV"></a><b>oops: oopsHV</b>
<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Opening-dirhandle-0x25s-also-as-a-file"></a><b>Opening dirhandle %s also as a file</b>
<p>(W io deprecated) You used open() to associate a filehandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a dirhandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing
and is deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Opening-filehandle-0x25s-also-as-a-directory"></a><b>Opening filehandle %s also as a directory</b>
<p>(W io deprecated) You used opendir() to associate a dirhandle to
a symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a filehandle.
Although legal, this idiom might render your code confusing
and is deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Operation-0x220x25s0x220x3a-no-method-found0x2c-0x25s"></a><b>Operation "%s": no method found, %s</b>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no
handler was defined.  While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms
of other handlers, there is no default handler for any operation, unless
<code class="inline"><span class="w">fallback</span></code>
 overloading key is specified to be true.  See <a href="overload.html">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Operator-or-semicolon-missing-before-0x25s"></a><b>Operator or semicolon missing before %s</b>
<p>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For
example, if you say "*foo *foo" it will be interpreted as if you said
"*foo * 'foo'".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x22our0x22-variable-0x25s-redeclared"></a><b>"our" variable %s redeclared</b>
<p>(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before
in the current lexical scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory!"></a><b>Out of memory!</b>
<p>(X) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl has
no option but to exit immediately.</p>
<p>At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your
process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use <code class="inline"><span class="w">limit</span></code>
 and
<code class="inline"><span class="w">limit</span> <span class="w">datasize</span> <span class="w">n</span></code>
 (where <code class="inline"><span class="w">n</span></code>
 is the number of kilobytes) to check
the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use <code class="inline"><span class="w">ulimit</span> -<span class="w">a</span></code>

and <code class="inline"><span class="w">ulimit</span> -d <span class="w">n</span></code>
, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-0x25s-extend"></a><b>Out of memory during %s extend</b>
<p>(X) An attempt was made to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond
the largest possible memory allocation.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-0x22large0x22-request-for-0x25s"></a><b>Out of memory during "large" request for %s</b>
<p>(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request. However,
the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so a
possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Out-of-memory-during-request-for-0x25s"></a><b>Out of memory during request for %s</b>
<p>(X|F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.</p>
<p>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$^M</span></code>
 as an
emergency pool after die()ing with this message.  In this case the error
is trappable <i>once</i>, and the error message will include the line and file

<p>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+"small amount" bytes.  This error
is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,

Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the

<li><a name="Repeated-format-line-will-never-terminate-(~~-and-0x400x23-incompatible)"></a><b>Repeated format line will never terminate (~~ and @# incompatible)</b>
<p>(F) Your format contains the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence and a

</li>
<li><a name="Reversed-0x25s0x3d-operator"></a><b>Reversed %s= operator</b>
<p>(W syntax) You wrote your assignment operator backwards.  The = must

<p>(W io) The dirhandle you tried to do a rewinddir() on is either closed or not
really a dirhandle.  Check your control flow.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Runaway-format"></a><b>Runaway format</b>
<p>(F) Your format contained the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence, but it
produced 200 lines at once, and the 200th line looked exactly like the
199th line.  Apparently you didn't arrange for the arguments to exhaust
themselves, either by using ^ instead of @ (for scalar variables), or by
shifting or popping (for array variables).  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Scalars-leaked0x3a-0x25d"></a><b>Scalars leaked: %d</b>
<p>(P) Something went wrong in Perl's internal bookkeeping of scalars:
not all scalar variables were deallocated by the time Perl exited.
What this usually indicates is a memory leak, which is of course bad,
especially if the Perl program is intended to be long-running.</p>

<li><a name="Scalar-value-0x400x25s0x5b0x25s0x5d-better-written-as-0x240x25s0x5b0x25s0x5d"></a><b>Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]</b>
<p>(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a
single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar
value (indicated by $).  The difference is that <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="i">&amp;bar</span>]</code>
 always
behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
argument, while <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span>[<span class="i">&amp;bar</span>]</code>
 behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things
if you're expecting only one subscript.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, because
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See
<a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>

<p>(W syntax) You've used a hash slice (indicated by @) to select a single

<li><a name="Script-is-not-setuid0x2fsetgid-in-suidperl"></a><b>Script is not setuid/setgid in suidperl</b>
<p>(F) Oddly, the suidperl program was invoked on a script without a setuid

</li>
<li><a name="Search-pattern-not-terminated"></a><b>Search pattern not terminated</b>
<p>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a // or m{}
construct.  Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span></code>
 from a variable <code class="inline"><span class="i">$m</span></code>
 may cause this error.</p>
<p>Note that since Perl 5.9.0 a // can also be the <i>defined-or</i>
construct, not just the empty search pattern.  Therefore code written
in Perl 5.9.0 or later that uses the // as the <i>defined-or</i> can be
misparsed by pre-5.9.0 Perls as a non-terminated search pattern.</p>

<p>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a <code class="inline"><span class="q">?PATTERN?</span></code>

<p>The question mark is also used as part of the ternary operator (as in
<code class="inline"><span class="w">foo</span> ? <span class="n">0</span> <span class="co">:</span> <span class="n">1</span></code>
) leading to some ambiguous constructions being wrongly
parsed. One way to disambiguate the parsing is to put parentheses around
the conditional expression, i.e. <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">foo</span><span class="s">)</span> ? <span class="n">0</span> <span class="co">:</span> <span class="n">1</span></code>

<p>(F) You don't have System V shared memory IPC on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="!0x3d~-should-be-!~"></a><b>!=~ should be !~</b>
<p>(W syntax) The non-matching operator is !~, not !=~.  !=~ will be
interpreted as the != (numeric not equal) and ~ (1's complement)
operators: probably not what you intended.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x3c0x3e-should-be-quotes"></a><b>&lt;&gt; should be quotes</b>
<p>(F) You wrote <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a> <span class="q">&lt;file&gt;</span></code>

<li><a name="0x2f0x25s0x2f-should-probably-be-written-as-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>/%s/ should probably be written as "%s"</b>
<p>(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
as in the first argument to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/join.html">join</a></code>.  Perl will treat the true or false
result of matching the pattern against $_ as the string, which is
probably not what you had in mind.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="shutdown()-on-closed-socket-0x25s"></a><b>shutdown() on closed socket %s</b>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a shutdown on a closed socket.  Seems a bit
superfluous.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="SIG0x25s-handler-0x220x25s0x22-not-defined"></a><b>SIG%s handler "%s" not defined</b>
<p>(W signal) The signal handler named in %SIG doesn't, in fact, exist.
Perhaps you put it into the wrong package?</p>
</li>
<li><a name="sort-is-now-a-reserved-word"></a><b>sort is now a reserved word</b>
<p>(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs into anymore.
But before sort was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Sort-subroutine-didn't-return-a-numeric-value"></a><b>Sort subroutine didn't return a numeric value</b>
<p>(F) A sort comparison routine must return a number.  You probably blew
it by not using <code class="inline">&lt;=&gt;</code>
 or <code class="inline">cmp</code>
, or by not using them correctly.
See <a href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Sort-subroutine-didn't-return-single-value"></a><b>Sort subroutine didn't return single value</b>
<p>(F) A sort comparison subroutine may not return a list value with more
or less than one element.  See <a href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="splice()-offset-past-end-of-array"></a><b>splice() offset past end of array</b>
<p>(W misc) You attempted to specify an offset that was past the end of
the array passed to splice(). Splicing will instead commence at the end
of the array, rather than past it. If this isn't what you want, try
explicitly pre-extending the array by assigning $#array = $offset. See
<a href="functions/splice.html">splice</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Split-loop"></a><b>Split loop</b>
<p>(P) The split was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a split shouldn't
iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is what
happened.) See <a href="functions/split.html">split</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Statement-unlikely-to-be-reached"></a><b>Statement unlikely to be reached</b>
<p>(W exec) You did an exec() with some statement after it other than a
die().  This is almost always an error, because exec() never returns
unless there was a failure.  You probably wanted to use system()
instead, which does return.  To suppress this warning, put the exec() in
a block by itself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="stat()-on-unopened-filehandle-0x25s"></a><b>stat() on unopened filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to use the stat() function on a filehandle that

</li>
<li><a name="substr-outside-of-string"></a><b>substr outside of string</b>
<p>(W substr),(F) You tried to reference a substr() that pointed outside of
a string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the
length of the string.  See <a href="functions/substr.html">substr</a>.  This warning is fatal if
substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand side of an
assignment or as a subroutine argument for example).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="suidperl-is-no-longer-needed-since-0x25s"></a><b>suidperl is no longer needed since %s</b>
<p>(F) Your Perl was compiled with <b>-D</b>SETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW, but
a version of the setuid emulator somehow got run anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="sv_upgrade-from-type-0x25d-down-to-type-0x25d"></a><b>sv_upgrade from type %d down to type %d</b>

<p>(F) A (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct can have at most two
branches (the if-clause and the else-clause). If you want one or both to
contain alternation, such as using <code class="inline"><span class="w">this</span>|<span class="w">that</span>|<span class="w">other</span></code>
, enclose it in
clustering parentheses:</p>

<p>Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on <b>-w</b>.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20&nbsp;questions.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="syntax-error-at-line-0x25d0x3a-0x600x25s'-unexpected"></a><b>syntax error at line %d: `%s' unexpected</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="syntax-error-in-file-0x25s-at-line-0x25d0x2c-next-2-tokens-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>syntax error in file %s at line %d, next 2 tokens "%s"</b>
<p>(F) This error is likely to occur if you run a perl5 script through
a perl4 interpreter, especially if the next 2 tokens are "use strict"
or "my $var" or "our $var".</p>
</li>
<li><a name="sysread()-on-closed-filehandle-0x25s"></a><b>sysread() on closed filehandle %s</b>

<p>(W unopened) You tried to read from a filehandle that was never opened.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="System-V-0x25s-is-not-implemented-on-this-machine"></a><b>System V %s is not implemented on this machine</b>
<p>(F) You tried to do something with a function beginning with "sem",
"shm", or "msg" but that System V IPC is not implemented in your
machine.  In some machines the functionality can exist but be
unconfigured.  Consult your system support.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="syswrite()-on-closed-filehandle-0x25s"></a><b>syswrite() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime

<li><a name="'-T'-and-'-B'-not-implemented-on-filehandles"></a><b><code class="inline">-T</code>
 and <code class="inline">-B</code>

<p>(F) Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn't
know about your kind of stdio.  You'll have to use a filename instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Target-of-goto-is-too-deeply-nested"></a><b>Target of goto is too deeply nested</b>
<p>(F) You tried to use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto.html">goto</a></code> to reach a label that was too deeply nested
for Perl to reach.  Perl is doing you a favor by refusing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="tell()-on-unopened-filehandle"></a><b>tell() on unopened filehandle</b>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to use the tell() function on a filehandle that

</li>
<li><a name="telldir()-attempted-on-invalid-dirhandle-0x25s"></a><b>telldir() attempted on invalid dirhandle %s</b>

<li><a name="The-crypt()-function-is-unimplemented-due-to-excessive-paranoia"></a><b>The crypt() function is unimplemented due to excessive paranoia</b>
<p>(F) Configure couldn't find the crypt() function on your machine,
probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they
think the U.S. Government thinks it's a secret, or at least that they
will continue to pretend that it is.  And if you quote me on that, I
will deny it.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="The-0x25s-function-is-unimplemented"></a><b>The %s function is unimplemented</b>
<p>The function indicated isn't implemented on this architecture, according
to the probings of Configure.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="The-stat-preceding-0x25s-wasn't-an-lstat"></a><b>The stat preceding %s wasn't an lstat</b>
<p>(F) It makes no sense to test the current stat buffer for symbolic
linkhood if the last stat that wrote to the stat buffer already went
past the symlink to get to the real file.  Use an actual filename
instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="The-'unique'-attribute-may-only-be-applied-to-'our'-variables"></a><b>The 'unique' attribute may only be applied to 'our' variables</b>
<p>(F) This attribute was never supported on <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a></code> declarations.</p>

<p>(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS.  You tried to change or delete an
element of the CRTL's internal environ array, but your copy of Perl
wasn't built with a CRTL that contained the setenv() function.  You'll
need to rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine
<i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that the environ array isn't the
target of the change to
%ENV which produced the warning.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="thread-failed-to-start0x3a-0x25s"></a><b>thread failed to start: %s</b>

<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
<b>-T</b> option, but Perl was not invoked with <b>-T</b> in its command line.
This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a <b>-T</b> in a
script, it's too late to properly taint everything from the environment.
So Perl gives up.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by
editing the #! line so that the <b>-T</b> option is a part of Perl's first
argument: e.g. change <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="w">n</span> -T</code>
 to <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -T -<span class="w">n</span></code>
.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> <span class="w">scriptname</span></code>
, then the
<b>-T</b> option must appear on the command line: <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -T <span class="w">scriptname</span></code>

<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the

</li>
<li><a name="Unmatched-right-0x25s-bracket"></a><b>Unmatched right %s bracket</b>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more closing curly or square brackets than opening
ones, so you're probably missing a matching opening bracket.  As a
general rule, you'll find the missing one (so to speak) near the place
you were last editing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Unquoted-string-0x220x25s0x22-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word"></a><b>Unquoted string "%s" may clash with future reserved word</b>
<p>(W reserved) You used a bareword that might someday be claimed as a

</li>
<li><a name="Unrecognized-character-0x25s-in-column-0x25d"></a><b>Unrecognized character %s in column %d</b>

<p>(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl.  Don't do that.  (If you
think you didn't do that, check the #! line to see if it's supplying the
bad switch on your behalf.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Unsuccessful-0x25s-on-filename-containing-newline"></a><b>Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline</b>
<p>(W newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that

<p>Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be different flavors
of Perl executables, some of which may support fork, some not. Try
changing the name you call Perl by to <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl_</span></code>
, <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl__</span></code>
, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Unsupported-script-encoding-0x25s"></a><b>Unsupported script encoding %s</b>
<p>(F) Your program file begins with a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) which
declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot read.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Unsupported-socket-function-0x220x25s0x22-called"></a><b>Unsupported socket function "%s" called</b>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at
least that's what Configure thought.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Unterminated-attribute-list"></a><b>Unterminated attribute list</b>
<p>(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the
start of an attribute, and it wasn't a semicolon or the start of a
block.  Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous
attribute too soon.  See <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Unterminated-attribute-parameter-in-attribute-list"></a><b>Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list</b>
<p>(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while parsing
an attribute list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis
character was not found.  You may need to add (or remove) a backslash
character to get your parentheses to balance.  See <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Unterminated-compressed-integer"></a><b>Unterminated compressed integer</b>

a regular expression. Fix the pattern and retry.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Unterminated-0x3c0x3e-operator"></a><b>Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</b>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Useless-use-of-0x25s-in-void-context"></a><b>Useless use of %s in void context</b>
<p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a
value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very
often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">$one</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$two</span> = <span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>when you meant to say</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$one</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$two</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">$array</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>when you should have said</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">$array</span> = <span class="s">[</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">]</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
<a href="perlref.html">perlref</a> for more on this.</p>
<p>This warning will not be issued for numerical constants equal to 0 or 1
since they are often used in statements like</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="n">1</span> while <span class="i">sub_with_side_effects</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>String constants that would normally evaluate to 0 or 1 are warned
about.</p>
</li>

<p>(W) You did <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Useless-use-of-sort-in-scalar-context"></a><b>Useless use of sort in scalar context</b>
<p>(W void) You used sort in scalar context, as in :</p>

<p>This is not very useful, and perl currently optimizes this away.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Useless-use-of-0x25s-with-no-values"></a><b>Useless use of %s with no values</b>
<p>(W syntax) You used the push() or unshift() function with no arguments
apart from the array, like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push(@x)</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/unshift.html">unshift(@foo)</a></code>. That won't
usually have any effect on the array, so is completely useless. It's
possible in principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect
if the array is tied to a class which implements a PUSH method. If so,
you can write it as <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/push.html">push(@tied_array,())</a></code> to avoid this warning.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-freed-value-in-iteration"></a><b>Use of freed value in iteration</b>
<p>(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop?
This error is typically caused by code like the following:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <span class="i">@a</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">4</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span>

<p>You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated over.
For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does not do full
reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an item in the
middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>

<li><a name="Use-of-0x2fg-modifier-is-meaningless-in-split"></a><b>Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split</b>
<p>(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a></code>
operator.  Since <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/split.html">split</a></code> always tries to match the pattern
repeatedly, the <code class="inline">/g</code> has no effect.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-implicit-split-to-0x40_-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber
a subroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results
of a split() explicitly to an array (or list).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-inherited-AUTOLOAD-for-non-method-0x25s()-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
 subroutines
are looked up as methods (using the <code class="inline"><span class="i">@ISA</span></code>
 hierarchy) even when the
subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
<code class="inline"><span class="i">Foo::bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
), not as methods (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo</span><span class="w">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">$obj</span><span class="i">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
).</p>
<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
s.</p>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
 for non-methods from a base class
named <code class="inline"><span class="w">BaseClass</span></code>
, execute <code class="inline"><span class="i">*AUTOLOAD</span> = \<span class="i">&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</span></code>
 during
startup.</p>
<p>In code that currently says <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="i">@ISA</span> = <span class="q">qw(AutoLoader)</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 to
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span> <span class="q">&#39;AUTOLOAD&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-0x25s-in-printf-format-not-supported"></a><b>Use of %s in printf format not supported</b>
<p>(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible from
only C.  This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-0x25s-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of %s is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use,
generally because there's a better way to do it, and also because the
old way has bad side effects.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of--l-on-filehandle-0x25s"></a><b>Use of -l on filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W io) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file
it already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for.
The operation returned <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a></code>.  Use a filename instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-0x22package0x22-with-no-arguments-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of "package" with no arguments is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You used the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/package.html">package</a></code> keyword without specifying a package
name. So no namespace is current at all. Using this can cause many
otherwise reasonable constructs to fail in baffling ways. <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">strict</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>

instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-reference-0x220x25s0x22-as-array-index"></a><b>Use of reference "%s" as array index</b>
<p>(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably
isn't what you mean, because references in numerical context tend
to be huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.</p>
<p>If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so:
<code class="inline"><span class="i">$array</span>[<span class="n">0</span>+<span class="i">$ref</span>]</code>
.  This warning is not given for overloaded objects,
either, because you can overload the numification and stringification
operators and then you assumably know what you are doing.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-reserved-word-0x220x25s0x22-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of reserved word "%s" is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future
versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so you're better off either
explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of
use, or using a different name altogether.  The warning can be
suppressed for subroutine names by either adding a <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;</span></code>
 prefix, or using
a package qualifier, e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;our</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, or <code class="inline"><span class="i">Foo::our</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-tainted-arguments-in-0x25s-is-deprecated"></a><b>Use of tainted arguments in %s is deprecated</b>
<p>(W taint, deprecated) You have supplied <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/system.html">system()</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec()</a></code> with multiple
arguments and at least one of them is tainted.  This used to be allowed
but will become a fatal error in a future version of perl.  Untaint your
arguments.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Use-of-uninitialized-value0x25s"></a><b>Use of uninitialized value%s</b>
<p>(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
defined.  It was interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.</p>
<p>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you the
name of the variable (if any) that was undefined. In some cases it cannot
do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the undefined value
in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program and the operation
displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear literally in your
program.  For example, <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;that $foo&quot;</span></code>
 is usually optimized into <code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;that &quot;</span>
. <span class="i">$foo</span></code>
, and the warning will refer to the <code class="inline">concatenation (.)</code> operator,
even though there is no <code class="inline">.</code> in your program.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Using-a-hash-as-a-reference-is-deprecated"></a><b>Using a hash as a reference is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
<code class="inline"><span class="i">%foo</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;bar&quot;</span>}</code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">%$ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;hello&quot;</span>}</code>
.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1
used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have. It is now deprecated, and will
be removed in a future version.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Using-an-array-as-a-reference-is-deprecated"></a><b>Using an array as a reference is deprecated</b>
<p>(D deprecated) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
<code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">23</span>]</code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">@$ref</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">99</span>]</code>
.  Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to
allow this syntax, but shouldn't have. It is now deprecated, and will be
removed in a future version.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="UTF-16-surrogate-0x25s"></a><b>UTF-16 surrogate %s</b>
<p>(W utf8) You tried to generate half of an UTF-16 surrogate by
requesting a Unicode character between the code points 0xD800 and
0xDFFF (inclusive).  That range is reserved exclusively for the use of
UTF-16 encoding (by having two 16-bit UCS-2 characters); but Perl
encodes its characters in UTF-8, so what you got is a very illegal
character.  If you really know what you are doing you can turn off
this warning by <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;utf8&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Value-of-0x25s-can-be-0x2200x220x3b-test-with-defined()"></a><b>Value of %s can be "0"; test with defined()</b>
<p>(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob),
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/each.html">each()</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/readdir.html">readdir()</a></code> as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs
can return a value of "0"; that would make the conditional expression
false, which is probably not what you intended.  When using these
constructs in conditional expressions, test their values with the
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/defined.html">defined</a></code> operator.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Value-of-CLI-symbol-0x220x25s0x22-too-long"></a><b>Value of CLI symbol "%s" too long</b>
<p>(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the value of an
%ENV element from a CLI symbol table, and found a resultant string
longer than 1024 characters.  The return value has been truncated to
1024 characters.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-0x220x25s0x22-is-not-available"></a><b>Variable "%s" is not available</b>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be
declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
subs are created at run-time.) For example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><a name="f"></a>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$a</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></pre>
<p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of $a,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet. Conversely,
the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by
now been created and is live:</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">'sub f { $a }'</span> <span class="s">}</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><a name="f"></a>    sub <span class="m">f</span> <span class="s">{</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span>
	<a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">'$a'</span> <span class="s">}</span>
    <span class="s">}</span>
    <span class="i">f</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span>-&gt;<span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being
executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-0x220x25s0x22-is-not-imported0x25s"></a><b>Variable "%s" is not imported%s</b>
<p>(F) While "use strict" in effect, you referred to a global variable that
you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by
that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
front of your variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-length-lookbehind-not-implemented-in-m0x2f0x25s0x2f"></a><b>Variable length lookbehind not implemented in m/%s/</b>
<p>(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed and
known at compile time.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x220x25s0x22-variable-0x25s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-0x25s"></a><b>"%s" variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</b>
<p>(W misc) A "my", "our" or "state" variable has been redeclared in the current
scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous
instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note that the
earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope or until
all closure referents to it are destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-syntax"></a><b>Variable syntax</b>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Variable-0x220x25s0x22-will-not-stay-shared"></a><b>Variable "%s" will not stay shared</b>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>
<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.</p>
<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>

</li>
<li><a name="Version-number-must-be-a-constant-number"></a><b>Version number must be a constant number</b>
<p>(P) The attempt to translate a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">Module</span> <span class="w">n</span>.<span class="w">n</span> <span class="w">LIST</span></code>

</li>
<li><a name="Version-string-'0x25s'-contains-invalid-data0x3b-ignoring0x3a-'0x25s'"></a><b>Version string '%s' contains invalid data; ignoring: '%s'</b>
<p>(W misc) The version string contains invalid characters at the end, which
are being ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="v-string-in-use0x2frequire-is-non-portable"></a><b>v-string in use/require is non-portable</b>
<p>(W portable) The use of v-strings is non-portable to older, pre-5.6, Perls.
If you want your scripts to be backward portable, use the floating
point version number: for example, instead of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="v">5.6.1</span></code>
 say
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="n">5.006_001</span></code>
. This of course won't make older Perls suddenly start
understanding newer features, but at least they will show a sensible
error message indicating the required minimum version.</p>
<p>This warning is suppressed if the <code class="inline">use 5.x.y</code> is preceded by a
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="n">5.006</span></code>
 (see <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">VERSION</span></code>
 in <a href="functions/use.html">use</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Warning0x3a-something's-wrong"></a><b>Warning: something's wrong</b>
<p>(W) You passed warn() an empty string (the equivalent of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/warn.html">warn</a> <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></code>
) or
you called it with no args and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$@</span></code>
 was empty.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Warning0x3a-unable-to-close-filehandle-0x25s-properly"></a><b>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly</b>
<p>(S) The implicit close() done by an open() got an error indication on
the close().  This usually indicates your file system ran out of disk
space.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Warning0x3a-Use-of-0x220x25s0x22-without-parentheses-is-ambiguous"></a><b>Warning: Use of "%s" without parentheses is ambiguous</b>
<p>(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that
looks like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a
term or unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand
function has a default argument of 1.0, and you write</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a> + <span class="n">5</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>you may THINK you wrote the same thing as</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span> + <span class="n">5</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>but in actual fact, you got</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    <a class="l_k" href="functions/rand.html">rand</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">+5</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></pre>
<p>So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Wide-character-in-0x25s"></a><b>Wide character in %s</b>
<p>(W utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn't expecting
one.  This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).  The easiest
way to quiet this warning is simply to add the <code class="inline"><span class="j">:</span><span class="w">utf8</span></code>
 layer to the
output, e.g. <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/binmode.html">binmode</a> <span class="w">STDOUT</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&#39;:utf8&#39;</span></code>
.  Another way to turn off the
warning is to add <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span> <span class="q">&#39;utf8&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 but that is often closer to
cheating.  In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the
filehandle with an encoding, see <a href="open.html">open</a> and <a href="functions/binmode.html">binmode</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Within-0x5b0x5d-length-'0x25c'-not-allowed"></a><b>Within []-length '%c' not allowed</b>
<p>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="w">TEMPLATE</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
 only if
<code class="inline"><span class="w">TEMPLATE</span></code>
 always matches the same amount of packed bytes that can be
determined from the template alone. This is not possible if it contains an
of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *-length. Redesign the template.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="write()-on-closed-filehandle-0x25s"></a><b>write() on closed filehandle %s</b>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
before now.  Check your control flow.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="0x25s-0x220x5cx0x25s0x22-does-not-map-to-Unicode"></a><b>%s "\x%s" does not map to Unicode</b>
<p>When reading in different encodings Perl tries to map everything
into Unicode characters.  The bytes you read in are not legal in
this encoding, for example</p>
<pre class="verbatim">    utf8 "\xE4" does not map to Unicode</pre><p>if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'X'-outside-of-string"></a><b>'X' outside of string</b>
<p>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before
the beginning of the string being (un)packed.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="'x'-outside-of-string-in-unpack"></a><b>'x' outside of string in unpack</b>
<p>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after
the end of the string being unpacked.  See <a href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="YOU-HAVEN'T-DISABLED-SET-ID-SCRIPTS-IN-THE-KERNEL-YET!"></a><b>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</b>
<p>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the
sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip
about what you want.  Your best bet is to put a setuid C wrapper around
your script.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="You-need-to-quote-0x220x25s0x22"></a><b>You need to quote "%s"</b>
<p>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared,
which means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.  (If it IS
what you want, put an &amp; in front.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="Your-random-numbers-are-not-that-random"></a><b>Your random numbers are not that random</b>
<p>(F) When trying to initialise the random seed for hashes, Perl could
not get any randomness out of your system.  This usually indicates
Something Very Wrong.</p>
